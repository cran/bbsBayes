\item{quantiles}{vector of quantiles to be sampled from the posterior distribution Defaults to c(0.025,0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95,0.975)}

\item{alternate_n}{text string indicating the name of the alternative approach to calculating an annual index, Default is "n"}

\item{indices}{Stratum indices generated by \code{generate_strata_indices}}

\item{min_year}{Minimum year to plot}

\item{max_year}{Maximum year to plot}

\item{slope}{Logical, if TRUE, calculates an alternative trend metric, the slope of a log-linear regression through the annual indices. Default FALSE}

\item{jags_data}{Data prepared by \code{prepare_jags_data}, used
for input to the JAGS model}

\item{regions}{vector selcting regional compilation(s) to calculate. Default is "continental","stratum", options also include "national", "prov_state", "bcr", and "bcr_by_country" for the stratifications that include areas that align with those regions.}

\item{startyear}{Optional first year for which to calculate the annual indices if a trajectory for only the more recent portion of the time series is desired. This is probably most relevant if max_backcast is set and so trajectories for different time-periods could include a different subset of strata (i.e., strata removed)}

\item{drop_exclude}{logical indicating if the strata that exceed the max_backcast threshold should be excluded from the calculations, Default is FALSE (regions are flagged and listed but not dropped)}

\item{max_backcast}{an optional integer indicating the maximum number of years to backcast the stratum-level estimates before the first year in which the species was observed on any route in that stratum. 5 is used in the CWS national estimates. If the observed data in a given stratum do not include at least one non-zero observation of the species between the first year of the BBS and startyear+max_backcast, the stratum is flagged within the relevant regional summary. Default value, NULL ignores any backcasting limit (i.e., generates annual indices for the entire time series, regardless of when the species was first observed)}

\item{alt_region_names}{Optional dataframe indicating the strata to include in a custom spatial summary. Generate the basic dataframe structure with the \code{extract_strata_areas} function, then modify with an additional column indicating the strata to include in a custom spatial summary}

\item{Min_year}{Minimum year to calculate trends from (e.g., 1970). Default is NULL, in which case the trend is calculated from the first year of the time-series of the supplied annual_indices file}

\item{Max_year}{Maximum year to calculate trends to (e.g., 2018). Default is NULL, in which case the trend is calculated up to the last year of the time-series of the supplied annual_indices file}

\item{prob_decrease}{Optional vector of percent-change values to calculate the posterior probabilities that the population has decreased by at least this much (e.g., prob_decrease = c(50) would result in a calculation of the probability that the population has decreased by more than 50 percent over the period of the trend, i.e., less than half the population remains. Default is NULL, in which case no probability of decrease is calculated.}

\item{prob_increase}{Optional vector of percent-change values to calculate the posterior probabilities that the population has increased by at least this much (e.g., prob_increase = c(100) would result in a calculation of the probability that the population has incrased by more than 100 percent, i.e., doubled, over the period of the trend. Default is NULL, in which case no probability of increase is calculated.}

\item{pointwise}{If set to \code{TRUE}, a data frame is returned
that contains the pointwise LPPD for each count. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}}

\item{indices_list}{List of indices of annual abundance and other results produced by
\code{generate_cont_indices}}

\item{select}{logical flag to indicate if the continental data need to be selected out of an indices_list object that includes stratum, national, or other region-types. Default is FALSE}

\item{ci_width}{quantile to define the width of the plotted credible interval. Defaults to 0.95, lower = 0.025 and upper = 0.975}

\item{species}{Species name to be added onto the plot}

\item{title_size}{Specify font size of plot title. Defaults to 20}

\item{axis_title_size}{Specify font size of axis titles. Defaults to 18}

\item{axis_text_size}{Specify font size of axis text. Defaults to 16}

\item{add_observed_means}{Should the plot include points indicated the observed mean counts. Defaults to FALSE.  Note: scale of observed means and annual indices may not match due to imbalanced sampling among strata}

\description{
The functions listed below are deprecated and will be defunct in
  the near future. When possible, alternative functions with similar
  functionality are also mentioned. Help pages for deprecated functions are
  available at \code{help("-deprecated")}.

\code{generate_cont_indices} creates a data frame of the strata-weighed
  continental indices by year. This data frame can then be used to
  generate a population trajectory of the species.

\code{generate_cont_trend} calculates the geometric mean annual changes in population size.

\code{generate_regional_indices} creates a data frame of the strata-weighted
  regional indices by year. This data frame can then be used to
  generate a population trajectory of the species.

\code{generate_regional_trends} calculates the geometric mean annual changes in population size for composite regions.

\code{generate_strata_indices} creates a data frame of indices by year,
  factored by each stratum. These indicies can be used to generate
  trajectory plots of the species for each strata.

\code{generate_strata_trends} creates a data frame of trends by year,
  factored by each stratum. These trends are calculated using the indices
  generated by \code{generate_strata_indices}.

\code{p_waic} calculates effective number of parameters. This is
  used as a bias adjustment factor in the calculation of WAIC
  in the function \code{waic}.

Generates the trajectory plot of continental indices.

\code{waic} returns the Watanabe–Akaike information criterion (WAIC) for the
  supplied model. WAIC is a generalization of the Akaike information
  criterion onto singular statistical model.

\details{
NOTE: in order to calculated pWAIC, the model MUST track the parameter
  "lambda". In species that are data-rich, such as Wood Thrush,
  this produces extremely large JAGS objects, and takes up a considerable
  amount of memory when simulating with \code{run_model}
