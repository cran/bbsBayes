\description{
A sample dataset containing 10-stop counts of each bird species seen per route per year.
  NOTE: This only contains data for Pacific Wren, not the full data set.
  The full count set is obtained via the function \code{fetch_bbs_data}.
  The data is obtained from the United States Geological Survey and is
  subject to change as new data is added each year. See Details for citation.
