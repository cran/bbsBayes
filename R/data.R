#' Sample point count data per species (Pacific Wren only)
#'
#' A sample dataset containing 10-stop counts of each bird species seen per route per year.
#'   NOTE: This only contains data for Pacific Wren, not the full data set.
#'   The full count set is obtained via the function \code{fetch_bbs_data}.
#'   The data is obtained from the United States Geological Survey and is
#'   subject to change as new data is added each year. See Details for citation.
